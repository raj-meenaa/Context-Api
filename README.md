# React Context API Examples

A comprehensive collection of React Context API implementation examples demonstrating state management patterns in modern React applications. This repository contains two practical projects showcasing different use cases of Context API for managing global state without external libraries.

## Project Description

This repository serves as a learning resource for developers looking to understand and implement React's Context API. It features two fully functional examples that demonstrate how to use Context API for different real-world scenarios: user authentication state management and theme switching functionality. Each example is built with React 19, Vite, and follows modern React best practices.

## Features

### 1. User Authentication Context (01contextApi)

**What it does:**
- Manages user authentication state across components without prop drilling
- Provides login functionality with username and password input
- Displays user profile information conditionally based on authentication status

**How it works:**
- Creates a `UserContext` using `React.createContext()` to establish a global state container
- Implements a `UserContextProvider` component that wraps the application and provides access to user state
- Uses React's `useState` hook to manage the user data (username) in the provider
- Child components (`Login` and `Profile`) consume the context using `useContext` hook

**How to use:**
1. The `UserContextProvider` wraps all components that need access to user state
2. The `Login` component captures username and password, then calls `setUser()` from context when form is submitted
3. The `Profile` component reads the `user` value from context and displays welcome message if user is logged in
4. Behind the scenes:
   - When user submits login form, `setUser(username)` updates the context state
   - Context automatically re-renders all consuming components (`Profile`) with new user data
   - React's context propagation ensures efficient updates only to components using the context

**Technical implementation:**
```javascript
// Context creation with default values
const UserContext = React.createContext();

// Provider manages state and exposes setters/getters
<UserContext.Provider value={{user, setUser}}>
  {children}
</UserContext.Provider>

// Components consume context
const {user, setUser} = useContext(UserContext);
```

### 2. Theme Switcher Context (themeSwitcher)

**What it does:**
- Implements a dark/light theme toggle for the entire application
- Persists theme preference and applies it to all styled components
- Provides a smooth visual transition between themes

**How it works:**
- Creates a `themeContext` using `createContext()` with default theme mode and toggle functions
- Exports a custom `useTheme` hook for easy context consumption
- Uses a `ThemeProvider` to wrap the application and distribute theme state
- Implements theme switching via CSS classes on the HTML element

**How to use:**
1. The `ThemeProvider` wraps the application and provides `themeMode`, `lightMode`, and `darkMode` functions
2. The `ThemeBtn` component displays a toggle switch that users can click to change themes
3. The `Card` component applies theme-specific Tailwind CSS classes that respond to the current theme
4. Behind the scenes:
   - When toggle is clicked, `onChangeBtn()` handler checks checkbox state and calls `darkMode()` or `lightMode()`
   - These functions update `themeMode` state in the context
   - A `useEffect` hook watches `themeMode` changes and updates the HTML element's class
   - Tailwind CSS dark mode (`dark:` prefix) automatically applies appropriate styles
   - All components using theme-aware classes re-render with new theme styling

**Technical implementation:**
```javascript
// Context with default values and methods
export const themeContext = createContext({
  themeMode: "light",
  darkMode: () => {},
  lightMode: () => {}
});

// Custom hook for consuming theme
export default function useTheme() {
  return useContext(themeContext);
}

// Theme application via DOM manipulation
useEffect(() => {
  document.querySelector('html').classList.remove('light', 'dark');
  document.querySelector('html').classList.add(themeMode);
}, [themeMode]);
```

### 3. React 19 and Modern Tooling

**What it does:**
- Utilizes the latest React 19 features for optimal performance
- Leverages Vite for lightning-fast development and optimized builds
- Includes ESLint configuration for code quality and consistency

**How it works:**
- Vite provides instant hot module replacement (HMR) during development
- React 19's improved concurrent features ensure smooth UI updates
- ESLint enforces code standards and catches common React mistakes

**How to use:**
1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server with HMR
3. Run `npm run build` to create optimized production builds
4. Run `npm run lint` to check code quality and fix issues
